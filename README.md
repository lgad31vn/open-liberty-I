## open liberty

- Open Liberty is an open framework for the Java ecosystem that allows developing microservices using features of the Eclipse MicroProfile and Jakarta EE platforms.

## Eclipse MicroProfile Services
- EM (Eclipse Microprofile) is a set of specifications or technologies which fill up the gap of Java EE.
- EM includes these technologies bellow: 
    - Open Tracing:
  
    - Open API: writes interfaces and program models for developers to create API from restful endpoints

    - Rest Client: provides a type safe client that handles the communication between the client and service

    - Config: Allow developers to use outside sources to config the project

    - Fault Tolerance:

    - Metrics:   

    - JWT Propagation: provides a way to authenticate stuff

    - Health check:  provides a health endpoint allows to produce service to see if its up and running fine

    - CDI (Context and Dependency Injection): Through @Inject annotation provides objects with dependencies needed

    - JSON-P and JSON-B: make it easy to work with JSON by providing APIs for provessing JSON

    - JAX-RS: provides Java APIs used for creating RESTful web endpoints
